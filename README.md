# Battleship
Framework for creating AI that play battleship.

Open the solution in visual studio ( I used 2022). Run the project by clicking run in visual studio. The project to run should be set to BattleShipPublicSDK

The code is divided into two projects: BattleshipCore and BattleshipPublicSDK.

BattleshipCore has the framework for running Battleship matches.

BattleshipPublicSDK is the public project for creating bots and apps.

Currently there are 2 demontration apps inside BattleShipPublicSDK: a console app, and a windowed gui app.
These are for demonstration purposes and not intended to be production apps

To change the app: right click BattleShipPublicSDK > go to Properties > change the Startup object
